> Standardize image size  
	- All images resized to a uniform shape i.e., 512 × 512
=> Normalize color                     
	- Convert to RGB format for model compatibility 
=> Convert annotations → density maps  
	- Generate training labels as per density estimation 
=> Prepare `(image, density_map)` pair 
	- For DataLoader during training 
=> The flow : 
	Original Image (.jpg)
			|
	Resize + RGB Convert
			|
	Load Head Points (.mat)
			|
	Create Impulse Map
			|
	Apply Gaussian → Density Map
			|
	Save as .jpg + .npy
			|
	(image, density_map) pair ready

Data Visualization : 

=> Impulse Map
	- A blank matrix of size equal to the image where all values are 0 and each head coordinate is marked as 1
=> Density Map
	- Impulse map is converted into a smooth heatmap by applying a Gaussian filter
	- Sum of all values in density map ~ total number of people
=> Heat Map
	- Heatmap just applies a color mapping scheme over the density values.

- Image with annotated red head points that Confirms annotation correctness                  
- Impulse map to see Raw head locations visualized    
- Gaussian smoothed density map to Ground truth label for model training          
- Heatmap overlay on image to Realistic interpretation of density distribution
