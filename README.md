DeepVision Crowd Monitor AI for Density Estimation and Overcrowding Detection 
Project Description DeepVision Crowd Monitor is a Python-based AI solution for estimating crowd density and detecting overcrowding in images or video feeds. It uses a deep-learning crowd-counting / density-estimation model to output density maps, crowd counts, and helps flag potential overcrowded zones — useful for crowd monitoring in public spaces, events, or surveillance systems.
Example Workflow 
Launch the Streamlit app (app_streamlit.py) for live crowd monitoring. Feed an image / video stream or upload a file. The system outputs a density map, estimated crowd count, and highlights zones with high crowd density / possible overcrowding.
